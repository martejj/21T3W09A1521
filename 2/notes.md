## What is a bit? What is a byte?

<details>

A simple way of thinking of a bit is a box that can contain a 1 or a 0, which is binary as it can only contain 2 possibilities. This is in contrast to decimal where we can have a 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9 per 'box', allowing it to contain 10 possibilities.

A byte is 8 bits lined up together. Together they can store 2^8 = 256 combinations/numbers so each byte can count upto 256.

## Q1 - When should the types in stdint.h be used?

```c
#include <stdint.h>
                 // range of values for type
                 //             minimum               maximum
    int8_t   i1; //                 -128                  127
    uint8_t  i2; //                    0                  255
    int16_t  i3; //               -32768                32767
    uint16_t i4; //                    0                65535
    int32_t  i5; //          -2147483648           2147483647
    uint32_t i6; //                    0           4294967295
    int64_t  i7; // -9223372036854775808  9223372036854775807
    uint64_t i8; //                    0 18446744073709551615

## Precursor question - How do we store booleans in C? 

## Q4 - Consider a scenario where we have the following flags controlling access to a device.

```c
    #define READING   0x01
    #define WRITING   0x02
    #define AS_BYTES  0x04
    #define AS_BLOCKS 0x08
    #define LOCKED    0x10
```

The flags are contained in an 8-bit register, defined as:
unsigned char device;
Write C expressions to implement each of the following:

### Mark the device as locked for reading bytes

<details>

`device = (READING | AS_BYTES | LOCKED);`

</details>

<br>

### Mark the device as locked for writing blocks

<details>

`device = (WRITING | AS_BLOCKS | LOCKED);`

</details>

<br>

### Set the device as locked, leaving other flags unchanged

<details>

`device = device | LOCKED;`

## Q5 - Discuss the starting code for sixteen_out, one of this week's lab exercises. In particular, what does this code (from the provided main) do?

```c
    long l = strtol(argv[arg], NULL, 0);
    assert(l >= INT16_MIN && l <= INT16_MAX);
    int16_t value = l;

    char *bits = sixteen_out(value);
    printf("%s\n", bits);

    free(bits);
```

<details>

strtol(3) is a standard library funcion that converts a nul-terminated string passed as its first argument to an integer value (it returns long).

The third parameter value indicates what radix or numeric base to use; e.g., 10 for decimal. A value of 0 means values starting with 0x are interpreted as hexadeximal, values starting with 0 are interpreted as octal, and otherwise decimal.

strtol(3)'s second argument, if it is not NULL, allows for error checking: it is set to point to the first character that couldn't be understood.

We also check the value will fit in int16_t, a 16-bit signed integer by using assert(3).

sixteen_out needs to return a string allocated with (e.g.,) malloc(3): we call free(3) to release that allocation

### Q6 - reverseBits()

Given the following type definition

```c 
    typedef unsigned int Word;
```

Write a function

```c
Word reverseBits(Word w);
```

... which reverses the order of the bits in the variable w.
For example: If w == 0x01234567, the underlying bit string looks like:

0000 0001 0010 0011 0100 0101 0110 0111
which, when reversed, looks like:

1110 0110 1010 0010 1100 0100 1000 0000
which is 0xE6A2C480 in hexadecimal.
